- **Lead Roles**: Designated leads for specific project components to enhance accountability and streamline decision processes.
- **Feedback Loop**: Established mechanisms for continuous feedback to address concerns promptly and optimize project outcomes iteratively.

### Research Questions

The analysis aimed to answer the following research questions:

- What is the impact of minimum wage changes on unemployment rates in Canada and across different provinces?

### Model

- The following linear regression model was used to test the hypothesis if minimum wage increases affect unemployment rates in Canada:

  - :nerd_face:  $UR$ = $β_0$ + $β_1$ x MW + ϵ
  - Variables:
    - Dependent Variable (Y): Unemployment Rate (UR)
    - Independent Variable (X): Minimum Wage (MW)
  - $β_0$: The intercept term. This represents the predicted value of the Unemployment Rate when the Minimum Wage is zero. 
  - $β_1$: The slope term. This coefficient represents the change in the Unemployment Rate for a one-unit change in the Minimum Wage. 
      - If $β_1$ is positive, it suggests that an increase in the Minimum Wage is associated with an increase in the Unemployment Rate. 
      - $If β_1$ is negative, it suggests that an increase in the Minimum Wage is associated with a decrease in the Unemployment Rate.
  - ϵ: Error term, representing the random disturbances or factors influencing the unemployment rate that are not accounted for in the model.

- The following linear regression model was used to test the hypothesis if minimum wage increases affect unemployment rates across provinces: 
  - :nerd_face:  $UR_it$ = $β_i$ + $β_1i$ x $MW_it$ + $ϵ_it$
  - Variables:
    - Dependent Variable (Y): Unemployment rate in province 𝑖 at time 𝑡 ($UR_it$) 
    - Independent Variable (X): Minimum Wage in province 𝑖 at time 𝑡 ($MW_it$)
  - $β_i$: Intercept specific to province 𝑖 representing the baseline unemployment rate when the minimum wage is zero.
  - $β_1i$: Coefficient representing the change in the unemployment rate for a one-unit change in the minimum wage in the province 
𝑖.
  - $ϵ_it$: Error term, representing the random disturbances or factors influencing the unemployment rate that are not accounted for in the model.

## Findings: Impact of Minimum Wage Changes

### Regression Analysis for Canada

- Identified a statistically significant negative relationship (-0.3137 coefficient) between minimum wage and unemployment rate across Canada. 

- The $𝑅^{2}$ value of 0.337 indicated that 33.7% of unemployment rate variation can be explained by minimum wage fluctuations. [More details](https://github.com/hitechparadigm/team_project/blob/team-project-1/src/regression_Canada_average.ipynb)

**Plot Interpretation**

The scatter plot with the regression line shows that as the minimum wage increases, the unemployment rate tends to decrease, reinforcing the negative correlation observed in the regression analysis.

### Regional Variations by provinces:

- **Provincial Analysis**: Revealed diverse sensitivities to minimum wage changes; provinces like Quebec and New Brunswick exhibited strong correlations (e.g., $𝑅^{2}$ = 0.592 for Quebec), whereas Saskatchewan and Ontario displayed weaker correlations, suggesting influential roles of other economic factors. [More details](https://github.com/hitechparadigm/team_project/blob/team-project-1/src/regression_provinces.ipynb)

**Strong Negative Correlation Provinces**

- **Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, Quebec:**
  - These provinces show a strong negative correlation between minimum wage and unemployment rates, suggesting that increases in minimum wage lead to notable decreases in unemployment. This might reflect robust local economies where higher wages boost consumer spending and overall economic activity, thereby creating more jobs.

**Moderate Negative Correlation Provinces**

- **Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Manitoba, British Columbia:**
  - These provinces also exhibit a negative correlation, though to a lesser extent. The decrease in unemployment rates with higher minimum wages indicates beneficial effects, albeit less pronounced compared to the strong correlation provinces.

**Weak Negative Correlation Provinces**

- **Ontario, Saskatchewan:**
  - The weak negative correlations suggest that while higher minimum wages slightly reduce unemployment rates, the impact is minimal. This could be due to diverse economic activities and employment structures that dilute the direct effect of wage increases.

**No Significant Correlation**

- **Alberta:**
  - The lack of significant correlation in Alberta indicates that other factors overshadow the influence of minimum wage on unemployment rates. Alberta's economy, heavily influenced by the oil and gas industry, might have unique dynamics that decouple minimum wage changes from unemployment rates.

### Economic Insights and Future Research

Future research should delve into additional factors influencing unemployment rates and refine our understanding of Canadian labor market dynamics.

Key areas for future analysis include:

- Continued monitoring of minimum wage impacts on unemployment rates at national and provincial levels.
- Tailoring minimum wage policies to regional economic conditions and industry-specific factors.
- Exploration of broader economic contexts beyond minimum wage adjustments.

### Conclusion

:slightly_smiling_face:  This project contributes comprehensive insights into how minimum wage policies influence unemployment rates across Canadian provinces. By analyzing diverse datasets and employing robust methodologies, the findings provide valuable guidance for policymakers, businesses, and the public, aiding in informed decision-making and policy formulation.

Overall, the observed negative correlations between minimum wage and unemployment rates in most provinces suggest that :sparkles:**increasing the minimum wage can have positive economic effects**:sparkles: , such as reducing unemployment and improving living standards for low-wage workers. These findings align more closely with contemporary economic theories like Keynesian economics and efficiency wage theory, rather than classical economic theory.

Whether higher minimum wages are "good" or "bad" depends on the balance between the positive impacts on worker incomes and economic demand, and the potential challenges faced by businesses and specific sectors. Policymakers need to consider these factors and regional economic conditions when setting minimum wage levels to maximize the benefits and minimize potential downsides.

## Description

The team project consists of two modules. Each module requires participants to apply the skills they have learned to date, and explore a dataset of their choosing. The first part of the team project involves creating a simple program with a database in order to analyze a dataset from an open source, such as Kaggle. In the second part of the team project, teams will come together again and apply the skills developed in each of the data science or machine learning foundations certificate streams. Teams will either create a data visualization or a machine learning model.



Participants will work in assigned teams of 4-5.
